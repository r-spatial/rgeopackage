The goal of rgeopackage is to support reading and writing metadata associated with GeoPackage (gpkg) files and assist in writing reproducible GeoPackage files.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rgeopackage from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-spatial/rgeopackage")
```

## Overview

### Updating file timestamps

- `preset_timestamp()`: presets the file timestamp for usage by GDAL by setting the environment variable `OGR_CURRENT_DATE`.
The timestamp is adopted by GDAL during the entire session, unless `unset_timestamp()` is called.
- `amend_timestamp()`: overwrites timestamps in the `gpkg_contents` and `gpkg_metadata_reference` tables of an existing GeoPackage file.

By default, GDAL sets timestamps corresponding to system time, so GeoPackages change when rewriting. Both functions accept a `Date` or `POSIXct` object and use standard formatting for GeoPackage files.

## Related R packages

- The [`sf` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) allows users to set GDAL configuration options in `sf::st_write()` using the `config_options` argument ([see sf issue #1618](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1618#issuecomment-811231056)) and in `sf::st_read()` using the `options` argument (see [sf issue 1157](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1157)). These options only affect the specific read or write statement and do not persist during the session. `sf` also includes a set of GDAL functions (e.g. `sf::gdal_metadata()`) that are not intended to be called directly by the user but could be used to access and edit GeoPackage metadata.

- The [`vapour` package](https://hypertidy.github.io/vapour/index.html) provides access to the basic read functions available in GDAL including GeoPackage contents and extension tables.
